# PHSX815 Week2
Homework3 (written in C++) and Homework4 (in python) will be in this repository. 
## HomeWrok3 and HomeWork4
In the homework3, I have added a new funciton at the end of **Random.cc** to get a probaility distribution for six-headed coin toss. The program **randm2.C** can plot the probability distribution of this coin toss experiment.  
## How to Run the Program
This code can be run through *`ROOT`*. In case you don't have it in your system, you can install from here [https://root.cern/install/](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
Type the commad <> **`root randm2.C`** in the terminal or open the root in the terminal type root[0] **`.x randm2.C`**

I am new to python. So may be code has some bugs. to run the python program, type **`python FileName.py`**
